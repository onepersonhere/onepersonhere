# Resume

My first experience with programming is using scratch in my secondary school. 
It was a fun experience; 
it opened up my eyes to the myraid of possibilites that coding could achieve.

Despite that, I failed to pursue that interest due to personal and circumstantial reasons. 
However, during the lockdown in 2020, 
I was delighted to be accepted into the Stanford Code in Place Online course.
From there, I learned the basics of python and the correct method of thinking like a professional programmer.

In June 2021, witnessing the power that telegram bot could achieve, 
I decided to try out and programme my own bot.

Thanks to the help of my friend, https://github.com/nibmz7/
we successfully created the @cs_notes_bot for telegram that is currently hosted using firebase.
Afterwards, I decided to continue to pursue that interest by enrolling into the 
hyperskill Java Course by JetBrains Academy.
